"""Helper function for loading DVSim config files.

## Formats

Load config files in several formats including HJSON, JSON, and TOML. These
formats can be extended by registering a new decoder to a file extension.

## Include other config files

Configuration files can include other configuration files by including a key
named `import_cfgs` which contains a list of paths to other config files to
import. These are resolved and recursively evaluated such that the resulting
loaded configuration dictionary is the union of all the included configuration
files. The format of included configuration files need not be the same as the
parent config file.

## Primary and Child config files

The top level or primary config file may also contain child configuration
files. These are not merged into the primary configuration, but rather
registered as a child of the primary config. Child configurations are listed in
the `use_cfgs` attribute on the primary config.

NOTE: at the moment only the top level config (primary config) can contain
child configs. Configs that contain `use_cfgs` can not be listed in another
config files `use_cfgs` attribute.

NOTE: the list of merged configurations (`import_cfgs`) is removed from the
resulting config mapping data during the load process. This is to keep the data
clean at each stage passing on only the data the next stage needs. However for
debugging purposes it could be useful to preserve the provinance of each config
value. This information is not provided by preserving the list of imported
config paths (pre wildcard substitution), as the values could be a result of
different merged files... and wildcard substitutions.
